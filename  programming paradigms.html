            <h2>About Programming Paradigms</h2>
            <p>Programming paradigms are fundamental styles of computer programming. They dictate the structure, design, and execution of computer programs. Different paradigms emphasize different concepts and approaches to problem-solving. Understanding various programming paradigms helps programmers choose the most suitable approach for a particular problem.</p>

            <h3>Logic Programming</h3>
            <p>Logic programming is a declarative programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of formal logic to express programs. In logic programming, programs are written in the form of logical rules and facts, and computation is performed by applying logical inference rules to derive solutions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Declarative representation of problem-solving logic.</li>
                <li>Automatic handling of control flow and backtracking by the inference engine.</li>
                <li>Well-suited for applications involving symbolic computation and knowledge representation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Complexity in expressing certain types of algorithms and procedural tasks.</li>
                <li>Performance overhead associated with backtracking and search algorithms.</li>

                <h3>Functional Programming</h3>
            <p>Functional programming is a declarative programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. In functional programming, programs are composed of pure functions that produce deterministic outputs based solely on their inputs, without side effects or mutable state.</p>
            <h3>Advantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Emphasis on immutability and referential transparency for easier reasoning and testing.</li>

                <li>Support for higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and function composition.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Disadvantages:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with functional concepts and syntax.</li>
                <li>Performance overhead associated with function invocation and recursion.</li>

            <h3>Procedural Programming</h3>
            <p>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of procedures, or routines, that perform computations or tasks. In procedural programming, the focus is on defining step-by-step instructions to solve a problem, with an emphasis on procedural abstraction and modularization.</p>
